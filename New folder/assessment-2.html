                “Life is meant to be lived from a Center, a divine Center…Life from the Center is a life of unhurried
                peace and power. It is simple. It is serene. It is amazing. It is triumphant. It is radiant. It takes no
                time, but it occupies all our time. And it makes our life programs new and overcoming. We need not get
                frantic. He is at the helm. And when our little day is done we lie down quietly in peace, for all is
                well.

                Here’s a quote from ultramarathoner Dick Collins: Decide before the race the conditions that will cause
                you to stop and drop out. You don’t want to be out there saying, “Well gee, my leg hurts, I’m a little
                dehydrated, I’m sleepy, I’m tired, and it’s cold and windy.” And talk yourself into quitting. If you are
                making a decision based on how you feel at that moment, you will probably make the wrong decision.
            </p>

                And a big aquarium. An aquarium under the water, inside the ship, where we keep the fish and
                squids and stuff we like.Simon Stimson: "...That's what it was to be alive. To move about in a cloud of
                ignorance; to go up and down trampling on the feelings of those about you. To spend and waste time as
                though you had a million years. To be always at the mercy of one self-centered passion, or another.Ours
                is only a little power, seems like, next to theirs," Moss said. "But it goes down deep. It's all roots.
                It's like an old blackberry thicket. And a wizard's power's like a fir tree, maybe, great and tall and
                grand, but it'll blow right down in a storm. Nothing kills a blackberry bramble.Pure honesty" is dead in
                a jungle of eternal, bloody impunity, rampant corruption and dirty politics. ~ Angelica Hopes, K.H.
                TrilogyI've noticed that there is danger in spending all this time writing about those "publicans and
                sinners" over there in the great and spacious building. If our spot near the tree of life becomes a
                rameumptom where we congratulate each other on our chosen-ness and look down on everyone else, then
                One of my favorite quotes is from a local hairdresser who went off to live in Rome. Lucky
